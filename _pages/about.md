I am an economist interested in research on Public Policy, Education, Infrastructure, and Poverty and Inequality. I am currently working at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/departments/ine) as an external consultant for the Infrastructure and Energy Sector. Before joining IADB I completed a Master in Economics at [Universidad de San Andr√©s](https://udesa.edu.ar/). I have also completed a [MicroMaster in Data, Economics and Development Policy at MITx on edX](https://www.edx.org/data-economics-development-policy-micromasters). During my years as a student, I was a member of [Centro de Estudios para el Desarrollo Humano](https://udesa.edu.ar/centro-de-estudios-cedh).
